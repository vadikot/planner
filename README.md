# Planner App

The main idea is that the App will help users achieve their goals and make their life
better. Users will be able to set goals for the year, create tasks for each day and categories
for them, customize the workspace as they want and see how much time they spent on the tasks
and goals.

**Note: Right now, it's just a prototype with only a few features implemented. Latest updates in
"develop" branch. The application is developed in native JS.**
